  - admin: "Added Datum Tagging, a new admin tool for quickly marking and referring back to various datums and atoms. You can tag atoms by ctrl+middle clicking them or using the right click context menu, or from their VV dropdown menu (especially for abstract datums that can't be clicked)."
  - admin: "The View-Tags menu can quickly be accessed by F9 default, or using the View-Tags button at the bottom of the Admin -> Game status panel section."
  - admin: "Tagged datums can also be referenced for things like proccalls and VV var edits, similarly to Marked objects."
